# HandGestureRecognization
A Gesture is a form of non-verbal communication in which visible bodily actions communicate particular messages, either in place of speech or together and in parallel with words. Gesture include movement of the hands, face, or other parts of the body.

## Basic Working Of Gestures

## Applications of Hand Gesture Recognition Technology

### Automotive
The BMW 7 Series has a built-in HGR system that recognizes five gestures and can control
music and incoming calls, among other things. Less interaction with the touchscreen makes
the driving experience safer and more convenient. 

### Healthcare
Emergency rooms and operating rooms may be chaotic, with lots of noise from personnel and
machines. In such environments, voice commands are less effective than gestures.
Touchscreens are not an option either, since thereâ€™s a strict boundary between what is and is
not sterile. But accessing information and imaging during surgery or another manipulation is
possible with HGR tech, as proven by Microsoft. GestSure provides doctors with the ability to
check MRI, CT, and other imagery with simple gestures without scrubbing out.

### Virtual reality
A hand tracking application from ManoMotion recognizes gestures in three dimensions using a
smartphone camera (on both Android and iOS) and can be applied in AR and VR environments.
The use cases for this technology include gaming, IoT devices, consumer electronics, and robots.

### Consumer electronics
These days, the consumer market is open for new experiences in HMI, and hand gesture
recognition technology is a natural evolution from touchscreens. Demand for smoother and more
hygienic means of interaction with devices as well as a concern for driver safety are pushing the
adoption of HGR in industries from healthcare to automotive and robotics. And while software
development for gesture recognition systems is quite challenging, expertise in AI, deep learning,
computer vision, and innovative hardware from top tech providers make HGR solutions more
affordable than they were even a few years ago.

## Conclusion

 Gesture recognition algorithm is relatively
robust and accurate

Convolution can be slow, so there is
tradeoff between speed and accuracy

In the future, we will investigate other methods of extracting feature vectors, without
performing expensive convolution operations
